# Accordion Code Challenge

The following component was created following the guidelines defined by code challenge.

<details>
    <summary><u>Guidelines</u></summary>
    <br/>

### Create React App
- Create a basic, new React application.
- Use any framework or build tool you would like (create-react-app, Vite, Next.js, etc).

### Create functional react Accordion
- Create a new functional React "Accordion" component that displays child components as sections.
- Each section will be hidden by default with a title that is shown at all times.
- If the title is clicked on, the section and its contents will toggle between being hidden and showing.

### Make the component reusable and modular
- The component should be fully reusable and modular so it can take in a dynamic amount of children.

### Only one Section Open
- Only one section inside the Accordion should be opened at a time.
- If the user opens a new section, the previous one will close.

### Use the component
- Use the new component you created and take each bullet point within these directions and use them as the sections inside the Accordion.
- The main bullet should be the title with each of the sub-bullet points being the contents.

### Make it look nice
- (extra) Add additional styling and animations to your component to show off your design skills.

## Technical Decisions

- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Component**:
  - **Type**: Client Component
  - **Pattern**: Composition Pattern
  - **Additional Information**:
    - Used Context API and custom hooks to share and read information between components to avoid prop drilling.
    - Extended Accordion components to allow passing their respective HTML Attributes to work with Microdata.
    - Added `ARIA` attributes for accessibility
